# Java-Codefiles
## ðŸ‘‹Hey, 
This repository contains code files related to Java Language, libraries, data structures and problem solved in Java <br>

## Java language:
> includes lambdas, threads, regex, JDBC

### [Lambda expressions](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/lambdas)
> Lambda expression is a syntactical sugar that came with Java 8 and makes it handy to work with functional interfaces and streams by reducing the amount of code that was to be written.

### [Threads](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Threads)
> Java has a great multi threaded environment.
> This folder contains basic ways of implementing threads in java and classical problems like Producer - Consumer, Deadlock and demonstrations of some classes (Reentrant lock, FairLock) that are in _java.lang.Object_ and _java.lang.Thread_ 

## Data Structures: <br/>
### [Linked List](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Data_structures_And_Algo/LinkedList)
> contains implementation of linked list and some related problems <br>

### [Graph](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Data_structures_And_Algo/Graph) 
> contains different implementations of graph and graph algorithms along with
> [Disjoint sets](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Data_structures_And_Algo/Graph/DisjointSets)

### [Trees](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Data_structures_And_Algo/Trees)
> contains tree implementations, traversals of binary tree and binary search trees

### [Segment Trees](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/Data_structures_And_Algo/SegmentTrees)
> contains segment tree, lazy propagation, Fenwick tree (Binary-indexed tree)

## Problem Solving
> contains algorithms for different problems

### [Backtrack](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/ProblemSolving/BackTrack)

### [Dynamic programming](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/ProblemSolving/DP)

### [Trie problems](https://github.com/shivu2002a/Java-Codefiles/tree/master/ProblemSolving/Trie)
